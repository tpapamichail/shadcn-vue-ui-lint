# Documentation

Start with [Get started](../README.md#get-started) to set up ESLint for Vue files.

## Guides

- [Configuring your design system](./design-systems.md): variants, contracts, and custom messages.
- [Adding linting to an existing project](./adoption.md): start with warnings and add rules as you go.
- [How it works](./how-it-works.md): how the linter reads your components and theme, and what it can check.
- [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md): stale results, missing components, and theme warnings.
- [Evals](./evals.md): how we measure the linter, results, and reproduction steps.

## Rules
