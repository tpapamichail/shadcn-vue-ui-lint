# API reference

## Plugin

The package exports `plugin` as both a named and default export. There is
no shared config; enable each rule explicitly. Rules read the AST ESLint
parses, so `.vue` files need `vue-eslint-parser` in the config.

The package is an ES module and requires Node.js 20.19 or later.
`eslint.config.mjs` is the documented path. Node.js 20.19 and 22.12 added
`require` for ES modules, so a CommonJS `eslint.config.js` also works on
those versions or later.

## Experimental project API

The experimental `project` export exposes the information used by the
rules. Its shapes may change before 1.0:

| Method                                             | Returns                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `projectFor(fromFile: string)`                     | Project metadata, or `null`                            |
| `themeFileFor(fromFile: string)`                   | Theme CSS path, or `null`                              |
| `colorTokensFor(fromFile: string)`                 | `Set<string>` of color names, or `null`                |
| `componentsFor(fromFile: string)`                  | Component index with `dir`, `files`, `has`, and `owns` |
| `variantDefinitionsOf(file: string)`               | Definitions with `name`, `axes`, and `source`          |
| `variantNamesFor(file: string, component: string)` | Variant names, or `null`                               |

Pass a file in the project to the discovery methods, and a component's
defining file to the variant methods:

```ts
import { resolve } from "node:path"
import { project } from "@tpapamichail/shadcn-vue-lint"

const theme = project.themeFileFor(resolve("src/App.vue"))
const variants = project.variantNamesFor(
  resolve("src/components/ui/button/Button.vue"),
  "Button"
)
```

## Editor completion

Importing the plugin adds completion for all six rule names in ESLint
flat configs on ESLint 9.39 or later; earlier versions lint the same
but do not type the options. The grammar, category table, collector,
and caches are internal APIs.
